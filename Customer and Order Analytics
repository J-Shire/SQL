#In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple table in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
#OR
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Products from Feb at specific location
SELECT sum(Quantity), product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8. Order dates
select orderdate
from bit_db.febsales
where orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' and '02/18/19 00:00'

#9. Location of a specific order
select location
from bit_db.febsales
where orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35'

#10. Total products on a date
select sum(quantity)
from bit_db.febsales
where orderdate like '02/18/19%'

#11. Specific Product
select distinct product
from bit_db.febsales

#12. Any product over a specific price
select distinct product, price
